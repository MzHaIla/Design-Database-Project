# Design-Database-Project
Develop a database based on an organization
**1. Choose an organization as a model (real world model) . Groups who uses internet-based company, must collect requirements from the owners of the site in a FACE-TO-FACE interview.**
For example: MPH bookshop in Mid-Valley Megamall or Klinik Murthi near University Towers.
Problems: For security purpose some organizations might not like your presence, so find other organizations.
Do not go into detail to see their systems or databases, just understand their workflow and data flow, that’s ALL!
**2. Design the database**
- Create ERD segments to model the modules you define in step 4. Remember that each of the ERD’s entities will be implemented through a database table.
**3. Develop the database**
- Develop a database based on Assignment 1 using **Oracle or MS Access**.
- Use SQL for query purposes based on user requirements (reports that user wants to generate). Write SQL statements to handle data manipulation (Add, Edit, Delete, Search.) within the application domain.
- Test the database system thoroughly.
