# Design-Database-Project
Develop a database based on an organization <br />
**1. Choose an organization as a model (real world model) . Groups who uses internet-based company, must collect requirements from the owners of the site in a FACE-TO-FACE interview.** <br />
For example: MPH bookshop in Mid-Valley Megamall or Klinik Murthi near University Towers. <br />
Problems: For security purpose some organizations might not like your presence, so find other organizations. <br />
Do not go into detail to see their systems or databases, just understand their workflow and data flow, that’s ALL! <br />
**2. Design the database** <br />
- Create ERD segments to model the modules you define in step 4. Remember that each of the ERD’s entities will be implemented through a database table. <br />
**3. Develop the database** <br />
- Develop a database based on Assignment 1 using **Oracle or MS Access**. <br />
- Use SQL for query purposes based on user requirements (reports that user wants to generate). Write SQL statements to handle data manipulation (Add, Edit, Delete, Search.) within the application domain. <br />
- Test the database system thoroughly. <br />
